# Project Instructions:
The **•Program Files** directory refers to **"C:\Program Files"** and indicates the folders and files that should be inside, since
by default the program looks for and generates files on that path.

The **•Fonts** directory contains all the fonts that should be installed before, because by default, the program uses those fonts
(also refers to **"C:\Windows\Fonts"**).

Everything else is as you normally know it. ♥

# How does it work
There are two sections **Control Panel** and **Recycle Bin**, choose the one you want and simply press **Add** or **Remove** and wait
until the button returns to normality. If required, you follow the steps indicated below the buttons **(Open a new window or
Log Off - but you can Restart too)** to see the changes.

**REMEMBER:** You must be an administrator user because you will make changes to your system. ♥
